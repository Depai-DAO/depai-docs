# Task Center
The Task Center allows you to earn more points, and all tasks can receive a corresponding multiplier bonus in different seasons.

## Invite rewards
Share your referral link with your friends. When they sign up using your link, it counts as a successful activation, and you'll earn the associated reward.

### Rules:
