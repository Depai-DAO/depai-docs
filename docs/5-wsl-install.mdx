# WSL Installation

This guide will help you install and configure WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows, allowing you to run Linux-based command-line tools and applications.

## System Requirements

1) **Operating System Version**:
    - WSL 2 requires **Windows 10 version 1903 or higher** or **Windows 11**.
    - Ensure that your Windows OS is updated to the latest version.

2) **Hardware Requirements**:
    - x64 systems: Support both WSL 1 and WSL 2.
    - ARM64 systems: Only support WSL 1.

3) **Virtualization Support**:
    - Your computer must have virtualization enabled, which can usually be done in the BIOS/UEFI settings. Refer to your device manual for specific steps.

---

## Enabling WSL

1) Open PowerShell as Administrator:
    - Type `PowerShell` in the Windows search bar, right-click, and select **"Run as Administrator"**.

2) Enter the following command to enable WSL:
   ```powershell
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
   ```

3) Enable the Virtual Machine Platform (necessary for WSL 2):
   ```powershell
   dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
   ```

4) Restart your computer to apply the changes.

## Installing WSL

1) Open PowerShell as Administrator.

2) Run the following command to install WSL and the latest version of the Linux kernel:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

    - This will automatically install WSL 2 and a default Linux distribution (usually Ubuntu).

3) To install a specific Linux distribution, list available distributions with:
   ```powershell
   wsl --list --online
   ```

    - To install a specific distribution (e.g., Ubuntu):
      ```powershell
      wsl --install -d Ubuntu
      ```

4) After installation, you'll be prompted to set a Linux username and password.

## Installing Linux Distributions

You can also install other Linux distributions from the Microsoft Store. Follow these steps:

1) Open Microsoft Store.

2) Search for the Linux distribution you want to install (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora).

3) Click **"Get"** or **"Install"** and wait for the installation to complete.

4) Once installed, launch the distribution and follow the prompts to set up your username and password.

## Setting WSL 2 as Default

If you've enabled WSL 2, make sure it's set as the default version for better performance.

1) Open PowerShell as Administrator.

2) Run the following command to set WSL 2 as the default version:
   ```powershell
   wsl --set-default-version 2
   ```

3) If you've already installed a Linux distribution and want to convert it to WSL 2, use this command:
   ```powershell
   wsl --set-version <DistroName> 2
   ```

    - For example, to set Ubuntu to WSL 2:
      ```powershell
      wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
      ```

4) Check the current distributions and WSL versions:
   ```powershell
   wsl --list --verbose
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### 1) **Virtualization Not Enabled**
- If you receive an error indicating that virtualization is not enabled when installing WSL 2, check your BIOS settings and ensure that virtualization technology (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) is enabled.

### 2) **WSL 2 Installation Fails**
- Ensure your Windows version meets the WSL 2 requirements. Run `winver` to check if your Windows version is 1903 or higher.

### 3) **Upgrading from WSL 1 to WSL 2**
- If your current WSL version is 1 and you'd like to upgrade to WSL 2, run the following command:
  ```powershell
  wsl --set-version <DistroName> 2
  ```

### 4) **Network Issues**
- If WSL can't connect to the internet, try disabling and re-enabling WSL:
  ```powershell
  wsl --shutdown
  wsl
  ```
