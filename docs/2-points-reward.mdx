# Points Reward

Points are designed into three categories. The first category is **u point**, which is the points earned by users for using Depai. The second category is **v point**, which is the points earned by validators for completing task scheduling. The third category is **w point**, which is the points earned by workers for completing inference tasks or for being effectively online.

Depai will conduct Alpha testing, Testnet, and Main Beta launches seasonally, and increase the points by multiples every season. The multiples apply to **u point**, **v point**, and **w point** at the same time. To ensure the rights and interests of old users, the season multiples will be reduced every season, as shown in the following table:

### Table 2-1 Season multiple for u point, v point, and w point

| No.  | Season | Season Multiple |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1.   | Alpha  | 20              |
| 2.   | 1      | 10              |
| 3.   | 2      | 9               |
| 4.   | 3      | 8               |
| 5.   | 4      | 7               |
| 6.   | 5      | 6               |
| 7.   | 6      | 5               |
| 8.   | 7      | 4               |
| 9.   | 8      | 3               |
| 10.  | 9      | 2               |
| 11.  | 10     | 1               |

## U Point

Users can earn **u point** rewards by asking questions through the **Ask AI to Earn App**. For each question asked and answered, **u points** can be earned. The maximum number of times to earn **u points** within a 24-hour period is limited to 100. To ensure the validity of the questions, the system will evaluate the quality of the questions, with high-quality questions receiving more **u points**. The assessment of question quality will be completed by AI, and the quality will be divided into 10 levels from low to high.

The **u points** that can be earned for each question = the number of tokens in the question * the quality level of the question * season multiple (Formula 2-1)

**Example:**
A user asked one question during season 1:
*"Please tell me a story."*
The AI assessed the number of tokens as 6, the quality of the question as 5, and the season multiple for season 1 as 10. Therefore, the user earned **u points** = 6 * 5 * 10 = 300.

In the future, we will open up various behaviors through which users can earn **u points**, including following Depai's X, joining Depai's Discord, being active on Depai's X or Discord, and inviting friends to use Depai. We will also gradually launch a leaderboard system for **u points**.

## V Point

Validators can earn **v point** rewards through task scheduling. For each completed task scheduling, they receive 1 **v point**.

**Example:**
A validator who performed 10,023 task schedulings in a single day during season 1 (with a season multiple of 10) would earn **v points** = 10,023 * 10 = 100,230 for that day.

In the future, we will open up various behaviors through which validators can earn **v points**, including task verification and data synchronization tasks. We will also gradually implement a leaderboard system for **v points**.

## W Point

Workers can earn **w point** rewards by completing AI inference tasks and maintaining effective online.

### 1) Rewards for Completing AI Inference Tasks

Workers can earn **w points** for completing AI inference tasks, and the **w point** rewards are calculated according to the following formula.

First, calculate the total number of input and output tokens (`in_out_tokens`) using the following formula:
`in_out_tokens = (input_tokens / output_input_ratio_factor) + output_tokens`, where `output_input_ratio_factor` is the multiplier factor for output tokens compared to input tokens, currently set to 3 (Formula 2-2).

Next, calculate the **w points** earned for a single inference task using the following formula:
`Single inference task w points = in_out_tokens × wpoint_sharing_ratio × season multiple`,
where `wpoint_sharing_ratio` is the **w point** sharing ratio, currently set to 0.7 (Formula 2-3).

**Example:**
A worker completed one inference task in Season 2, where the season multiple is 9. The task had an input token count of 1,200 and generated an output token count of 382. The worker would earn **w points** = `[(1,200 / 3) + 382] * 0.7 * 9 = 4,926`.

To encourage workers to run larger AI models, Depai has introduced the parameter **"model size multiple"**; when calculating the number of tokens, the original number of output tokens will be multiplied by the corresponding **model size multiple**. The following table lists the current models and their corresponding size multiples:

### Table 2-2 Model size multiple for various models

| No.  | Model        | Model Size Multiple |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1.   | llama3.1:8b  | 1                   |
| 2.   | gemma2:27b   | 3                   |

**Example:**
Worker A ran the **gemma2:27b** model and completed one inference task in Season 2. The task's `in_out_tokens` count was 800. Since the model size multiplier for **gemma2:27b** is 3, the original `in_out_tokens` count of 800 will be multiplied by 3. The incentivized `in_out_tokens` will then be 800×3=2,400. Consequently, Worker A can earn **w points** = `2,400×0.7×9=15,120` for this task.

### 2) Effective Online Rewards

Additionally, workers can earn rewards for being effectively online. Depai will take a snapshot every one hour and reward workers for their effective online presence.

The **w points** earned for each snapshot = `(w_score / wscore_divisor_factor) * (snapshot interval seconds / interval_divisor_factor) * season multiple` (Formula 2-3).

**Example:**
A worker goes online at 10:10:55 AM on a certain day during season 3 (with a season multiple of 8) and goes offline at 12:13:58 PM. During this period, the worker performs multiple inferences, and Depai takes three snapshots at 10:00:00 AM, 11:00:00 AM, and 12:00:00 AM. The **w points** accumulated during these snapshots are as follows:

1. **10:00:00 AM**, No.1 Snapshot: `0 * (3,600 / 3) * 8 = 0`
This worker is just online, no inference tasks have been performed yet, no **w_score** has been generated, and it is judged as ineffective online.

2. **11:00:00 AM**, No.2 Snapshot: `(31 / 10) * (3,600 / 3) * 8 = 28,800`
At the time of this snapshot, the **w_score** of this worker is 31.

3. **12:00:00 AM**, No.3 Snapshot: `(42 / 10) * (3,600 / 3) * 8 = 38,400`
At the time of this snapshot, the **w_score** of this worker is 42.

The worker has accumulated 0 + 28,800 + 38,400 = **67,200 w points** in the above 3 snapshots.

In the future, we will open up a variety of behaviors through which workers can earn **w points**, including large model training tasks, data processing tasks, and model evaluation tasks. We will also gradually introduce a leaderboard system for **w points**.
