# Automatic Upgrades

To keep the client up to date, it's recommended to follow these steps for automatic upgrades:

1) Download the auto upgrade script:
```bash
$ curl -L -o depai_auto_upgrade.sh https://depai.online/cli/depai_auto_upgrade.sh && echo -e "\nDownloaded depai_auto_upgrade.sh"
$ curl -L -o nohup_run_depai.sh https://depai.online/cli/nohup_run_depai.sh && echo -e "\nDownloaded nohup_run_depai.sh"
```

2) Grant executable permissions to the files:
```bash
$ chmod +x depai_auto_upgrade.sh nohup_run_depai.sh
```

3) Starting the auto upgrade script:

In `nohup_run_depai.sh`, you can specify the model to start with. By default, the model is set to `llama3.1:8b`, but you can modify it to `gemma2:27b`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to upgrade Depai with model selection.
# This script supports two models: "llama3.1:8b" and "gemma2:27b".
# By default, it uses "llama3.1:8b". You can change it to "gemma2:27b" if needed.

# Choose your model by setting the model_name variable below.
# Available models:
# - "llama3.1:8b"
# - "gemma2:27b"

MODEL_NAME="llama3.1:8b"  # Default model, change to "gemma2:27b" if needed

# Run the upgrade script with the selected model
nohup ./depai_auto_upgrade.sh $MODEL_NAME > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Command to start the script:
```bash
$ ./nohup_run_depai.sh
```

**Note**: During the upgrade process, the worker may go offline for a few minutes. This is normal.
