# Introduction

## Overview
Depai, an abbreviation for DePIN-based AI Inference Network, is a combination of the two words "DePIN" and "AI", signifying a decentralized network that integrates DePIN technology with AI services.

Through Depai, global users can participate and earn rewards in two primary ways:

1) **Contribute computing power**: Users can contribute their idle computing resources to the Depai network, enhancing the network's computational power while also improving the utilization rate of these resources.

2) **Utilize AI inference services**: Users can take advantage of AI inference services such as Llama and Gemma provided by Depai, to obtain information and solutions by asking questions, and earn rewards in the process.

These approaches not only foster the sharing of resources and technological progress, but also bring practical benefits to users.

## System Functions
1) **Decentralized AI Cluster**

Integrate global computing resources to build an AI cluster based on DePIN.

2) **Deliver Ubiquitous AI Inference Services to Users**

All types of devices, including smartphones, laptops, and personal computers, can easily access and use efficient AI model inference services.

3) **Provide AI Development Support for Developers**

Offer OpenAI-compatible APIs to supply developers with online AI inference services like Llama and Gemma, accelerating the development process.

4) **Provide Cost-effective AI Computing Resources for Enterprises**

Through Depai, enterprises can obtain AI computing resources with higher cost-effectiveness than traditional cloud computing service providers.

## System Features
1) **Always Online**

Complete decentralization ensures that Depai is always online.

2) **Ultra-Fast Response**

The nearest and best-matched worker is scheduled to complete AI inference tasks, obtaining extremely fast response speeds through streaming interfaces.

3) **Innovative PoW**

Workers prove their work through AI tasks and are rewarded according to the work they complete.

4) **Earn More**

Workers can earn rewards for completing AI inference tasks or for being effectively online; users can also earn rewards for using AI services.

5) **Dynamic Supply and Demand Balance**

Through Depai's API, developers can create a diverse range of AI applications, achieving a balanced network of supply and demand, and continuously optimizing the user experience.
